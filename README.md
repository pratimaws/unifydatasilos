Converging your data silos to Redshift using DMS and using QuickSight for visualization and analytics

The source databases could be anywhere, for example at their on-premises facilities, or on any other cloud provider, on AWS on Amazon EC2 or on Amazon RDS or in a mixture of such locations.

We will use DMS to bring the two (or more) data sources into Redshift and run queries and analytics. Redshift is ideal for such data warehouse style analytics and scale easily up to 2 PB. The following diagram demonstrates what we are trying to achieve.

Once the data is available on Redshift, you could easily build BI dashboards and generate intelligent reports to gain insights using Amazon QuickSight. Amazon QuickSight provides very fast, easy-to-use, cloud-powered business intelligence for 1/10th the cost of traditional BI solutions. QuickSight uses a new, Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine (“SPICE”) to perform advanced calculations and render visualizations rapidly.
